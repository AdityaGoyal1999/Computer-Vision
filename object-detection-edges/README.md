## Object Detection with edges

Edges are a little more robust when trying to detect an object in an image. The entity that we're trying to detect doesn't have to be exactly the same on the main image. Even with some superficial changes, our algorithm can detect the image fairly well.

An edge indicates the boundary between important features of an image. With edges, we can not only detect objects in an image but segment images and understand the scene.

The edge detectors discussed here -

1. Canny Edge Detector
2. Sobel Edge Detector
3. Laplacian of Gaussians (LoG)
